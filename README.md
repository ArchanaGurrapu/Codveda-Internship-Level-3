LEVEL 3 - ADVANCED 🔹 Task 1: Basic File Encryption/Decryption

I developed a Python-based file encryption and decryption system to secure data using cryptographic techniques. The program allows users to select a file, encrypt it using a secure encryption key, and decrypt it back to its original form. This task helped me understand file handling, data security concepts, and the use of cryptography libraries in Python.
